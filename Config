#   This section defines installations to
#       various dependencies for sequence_handling
#   If you are able to use a module system for
#       dependencies, then uncomment the lines starting
#       with 'module load'
#   If you need to install a dependency from source,
#       then uncomment the lines for the depency and the
#       'export PATH=', and write the full path to the executable
#       for the program. For example:
#       PARALLEL=${HOME}/software/parallel-20151122/bin/parallel
#   If you have a system-wide installation for a program, you can
#       leave all lines commented out. sequence_handling will find
#       system-wide installed programs automatically.
